Okay, I understand. You want me to provide the TypeScript code for the file `/home/user/studio/src/app/admin/settings/actions.ts` with the line `admin.initializeApp();` on line 33 removed.

However, I need the current content of the file `/home/user/studio/src/app/admin/settings/actions.ts` to remove the specific line and return the modified code. I cannot directly see or edit your files without reading them first.

Please provide the **complete content** of your `/home/user/studio/src/app/admin/settings/actions.ts` file. Once you provide the content, I will remove the line `admin.initializeApp();` at the specified position and return the full modified code to you.

**I will not make a tool call to read the file, as per your instruction.** I am waiting for you to provide the content.
