# Seeding Script Creation Log

This file documents the conversation and process for creating the comprehensive database seeding script.

## User Request (Summary)

The user requested a unified and robust seeding script with the following requirements:

1.  **Test Plan:** Adhere to scenarios in `/home/user/studio/docs/TESTING_SCENARIOS.md`.
2.  **Data Volume & Variety:**
    *   Cover all combinations of auction modalities, strategies, types, and statuses.
    *   10 auctioneers.
    *   5 lots per auction.
    *   0-5 bids per lot.
    *   500 users.
3.  **Auction Status Distribution:** 5% draft, 10% finished, 20% relisted, ~65% in progress.
4.  **User Scenarios:** Simulate various user journeys (registration only, bidding, winning, paying, not paying).
5.  **Data Complexity:** Max complexity, all fields filled, assets linked.
6.  **Seeding Method:** Unify existing scripts and use application services/actions, not direct DB insertion for creation.
7.  **Verification:** Use counts and SQL checks (including `RANK`/`PARTITION`) to verify data integrity post-seed.
8.  **Resumability:** Log progress to a file to allow the script to be resumed if it fails.
9.  **Chat History:** Save this conversation for future reference.

## Gemini Plan

1.  **Unify Scripts:** Base the new unified script on `scripts/seed-from-scenarios.ts` as it already uses application services, which aligns with the core requirement of not writing directly to the database for data creation.
2.  **Implement Resumability:** Create a `scripts/seed-progress.json` file to track the completion of each major stage of the seeding process. The script will check this file to skip already completed stages.
3.  **Enhance Seeding Logic:**
    *   Read `prisma/schema.prisma` to get all `enum` values for auctions to ensure all combinations are created.
    *   Implement the requested auction status distribution.
    *   Flesh out the `simulateBiddingAndWins` function to create realistic user interactions (bids, wins, payments).
    *   Implement the `runDataVerification` function with raw SQL queries for detailed data validation after seeding is complete.
4.  **Execute:** Modify the `seed-from-scenarios.ts` script in stages to implement the above plan.
