## Style Guidelines:

- Use clean, consistent, line-based icons for categories and navigation.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience, such as hover effects and loading indicators.
- Use a predominantly white (#FFFFFF) and light gray (#F2F2F2) color scheme for backgrounds to create a clean, modern, and spacious feel.
- Employ a primary blue color (#3498db) for key interactive elements like buttons and links, providing a sense of trust and highlighting calls to action.
- Incorporate a secondary accent color, such as a soft green (#2ecc71), to indicate success or positive actions, adding visual interest without overwhelming the interface.
- Use 'Open Sans' (sans-serif) as the primary font for both headings and body text to maintain a consistent and readable typographic style.
- Implement a card-based layout with moderate rounded corners (e.g., 8px) and subtle shadows to create depth and separation between content sections.
- Ensure ample white space and consistent padding around elements to improve readability and visual appeal, creating a balanced and uncluttered layout.
