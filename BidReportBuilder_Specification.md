# BidReportBuilder Component Specification

## 1. Overview

The `BidReportBuilder` is a self-service reporting tool designed for the `bidexpert_ai_firebase_studio` application. It allows users (administrators, auction analysts, auctioneers, and consignors) to create, customize, and export reports in an intuitive, AI-assisted environment.

The component will be built using the following technology stack:

*   **Frontend:** React, Next.js
*   **Backend:** Node.js, Next.js API Routes
*   **Database:** Prisma
*   **Reporting Engine:** DevExpress Reporting

## 2. Architecture

The `BidReportBuilder` will follow a client-server architecture:

*   **Client (React/Next.js):** A rich, interactive frontend application that provides the report designer interface. It will use the DevExpress Report Designer and Document Viewer components for React.
*   **Server (Node.js/Next.js API Routes):** A backend that handles data requests, report processing, and AI-powered features. It will expose a RESTful API for the client to consume.
