# Project Progress - BidExpert

This document tracks the high-level progress of the BidExpert application.

## DONE
- **Database Migration:** Successfully migrated the entire data layer from a multi-adapter system to a single PostgreSQL database managed by Prisma ORM.
- **Admin Panel CRUD:** Implemented comprehensive CRUD operations for all major entities (Auctions, Lots, Users, Roles, Sellers, Categories, etc.).
- **User Authentication:** Built a secure login/logout and session management system using Next.js Server Actions and encrypted cookies.
- **Role-Based Access Control:** Implemented a permission system to protect administrative and role-specific routes.
- **Auction Creation Wizard:** Created a multi-step wizard with a flowchart visualization for creating new auctions.
- **Consignor Dashboard:** Implemented all sections of the consignor dashboard (Overview, Auctions, Lots, Sales, Reports, Settings) with real data.
- **Public-Facing Pages:** Developed key public pages including Home, Search, and various detail pages (Auction, Lot, Seller, etc.).
- **Initial AI Flows:** Scaffolding for Genkit AI flows has been created.
- **Context Persistence System:** Initial setup of the context tracking files (`PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md`, `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`, etc.).

## DOING
- **Full Data Integration:** Ensuring all components (especially complex client components) correctly fetch, display, and interact with the live Prisma database data via Server Actions.
- **Refining Search & Filtering:** Improving the main search page to ensure all filters work correctly across different data types (Auctions, Lots, Venda Direta).

- **Item 3.1:** Implement a blog/CMS module for content marketing.
- **E2E Testing:** Develop a comprehensive suite of end-to-end tests using a framework like Playwright to validate key user flows.
