# Project Progress - BidExpert

## DONE
- **Item 1:** **Core Architecture Refactoring:** Fully migrated the application to a layered MVC + Service + Repository architecture using Prisma ORM. This standardized data access and improved maintainability.
- **Item 2:** **Comprehensive Admin Panel:** Implemented full CRUD functionality for all major entities (`Auctions`, `Lots`, `Users`, `Sellers`, `Auctioneers`, `Categories`, `Judicial Entities`, etc.).
- **Item 3:** **End-to-End Testing:** Created a robust E2E test suite (`bidding-e2e.test.ts`) that simulates the entire lifecycle of both judicial and extrajudicial auctions, from user creation to bidding.
- **Item 4:** **Functional Dashboards:** Built and populated with data the main User Dashboard (`/dashboard/*`) and the Consignor Dashboard (`/consignor-dashboard/*`).
- **Item 5:** **Public-Facing Pages:** Developed key public pages including the Homepage, Search, and detailed views for auctions, lots, sellers, and auctioneers.
- **Item 6:** **User Authentication & Permissions:** Implemented a secure session-based authentication system with a granular, role-based permission model.

## DOING
- **Item 7:** **Auction Creation Wizard Enhancement:** Analyzing the `bidding-e2e.test.ts` results to identify and correct gaps in the Auction Wizard (`/admin/wizard`). Key tasks include:
    - Aligning the "Bens" data source with the auction type (Judicial vs. Extrajudicial).
    - Improving the Comitente selection logic for judicial auctions.
    - Enhancing the `WizardFlow` visualization to better represent the bifurcated logic.

## NEXT
- **Item 8:** **Full AI Integration:** Connect the UI to the existing Genkit AI flows (`suggest-listing-details`, `predict-opening-value`) to provide listing suggestions and predictions to users during the auction creation process.
- **Item 9:** **PDF Document Generation:** Implement the server-side logic using Puppeteer (as defined in `generate-document-flow.ts`) to generate PDFs for auction reports, certificates, and winning bid terms based on the created `DocumentTemplate` entities.
- **Item 10:** **Advanced UI/UX Features:**
    - Implement real-time updates for bids and auction status using WebSockets.
    - Expand the gamification system with more badges and rewards.
- **Item 11:** **Payment Gateway Integration:** Integrate a payment processor for handling auction deposits and final payments for won lots.
- **Item 12:** **Full Test Coverage:** Expand the E2E test suite to cover all remaining entities and user flows, ensuring complete application stability.
