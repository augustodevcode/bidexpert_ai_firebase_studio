# Instructions for Maintaining Project Context

These files (`PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md`, `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`, and `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`, `1st.md`) are designed to help maintain context and continuity across our interactions. Please follow these instructions to ensure they are used effectively:

## 1. Initialization at the Start of a Session

*   At the beginning of each new session, before starting any significant work, you will be provided with an initialization prompt (likely in a file like `1st.md` or similar).
*   Your first task should be to read and process the information contained within `PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md`, `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`, and `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
*   Confirm that you have read and understood the contents of these files before proceeding with further tasks.

## 2. Updating the Context Files

*   **Regular Updates:** The context files should be updated regularly, ideally after significant progress is made, new objectives are defined, or important decisions are made. I (the AI) will attempt to do this when explicitly asked or when a major milestone/resolution is achieved.
*   **`PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md`:**
    *   Append new key information to this file.
    *   Summarize important discussions, decisions, and outcomes of tasks.
    *   Include details about challenges encountered and how they were resolved.
    *   Maintain a chronological flow where possible, or use clear headings to organize information by topic or session. If a previous summary exists from me, I should append to it, often under a new "Session" or "Interaction" heading.
*   **`PROJECT_PROGRESS.md`:**
    *   Update the status of tasks in the "DONE", "WORKING", and "NEXT" sections.
    *   Move completed tasks from "WORKING" to "DONE".
    *   Add newly identified tasks or features to the "NEXT" section.
    *   Adjust tasks in the "WORKING" section to reflect current focus.
    *   Be concise and use bullet points for clarity.
*   **`PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md`:**
    *   Update these instructions if the process for using or updating the context files changes. This file is primarily for me (the AI) to remember the process.
*   **`1st.md`:**
    *   This file contains the prompt the user should provide at the start of a new session. It generally shouldn't change unless the core initialization process itself changes.

## 3. Using the Context Files During a Session

*   Refer back to `PROJECT_CONTEXT_HISTORY.md` to recall previous discussions, decisions, or technical details.
*   Consult `PROJECT_PROGRESS.md` to understand the current state of the project and identify the next priorities.
*   Review `PROJECT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` (these instructions) if you are unsure about how to proceed with updating the context or maintaining continuity.
*   Use the information in these files to inform your responses, generate code, and make suggestions that are consistent with the project's history and objectives.

## 4. Maintaining File Integrity

*   Ensure that the formatting of the markdown files remains consistent and readable.
*   Avoid introducing unnecessary or irrelevant information into the context files.
*   If making significant changes, consider reviewing the updated files to ensure accuracy and clarity.

By diligently following these instructions, we can create a persistent context that will significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our collaboration across multiple sessions.
