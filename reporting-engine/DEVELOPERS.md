# Developer's Guide

This guide provides a technical overview of the reporting engine and explains how to extend it with new features.

## Architecture

The reporting engine is designed with a component-based architecture. This means that new report elements and export formats can be easily added as plugins.

### Core Rendering Engine

The core rendering engine is responsible for taking a report definition and a format, and then calling the appropriate renderer (PDF, HTML, etc.) to generate the report.

### Report Definition Schema

The report definition schema is a JSON schema that describes the structure of a report, including its pages, sections, elements, and data bindings.

### Data Processing and Aggregation

The data processing and aggregation module is responsible for connecting to various data sources, executing queries, and performing data aggregation (e.g., grouping, sorting, summarizing).

### Components

The reporting engine includes a set of built-in components that can be used to create reports. These components include:

*   **Text:** A component for rendering text.
*   **Image:** A component for rendering images.
*   **Chart:** A component for rendering charts.
*   **Table:** A component for rendering tables.
*   **ChartComponent:** A component for rendering charts.
*   **TableComponent:** A component for rendering tables.

## Extending the Reporting Engine

### Adding a New Report Element

To add a new report element, you need to create a new component that extends the `ReportComponent` base class. You also need to update the report definition schema to include the new element type.

### Adding a New Export Format

To add a new export format, you need to create a new renderer that takes a report definition and generates the report in the new format. You also need to update the core rendering engine to include the new format.
